                <h2>What is coffee?</h2>
                <br>
                <p id="p4">
                    Everyone recognizes a roasted coffee bean, but you might not recognize an actual coffee plant.

                    White flowers on coffee tree
                    Coffee trees are pruned short to conserve their energy and aid in harvesting, but can grow to more
                    than 30 feet (9 meters) high. Each tree is covered with green, waxy leaves growing opposite each
                    other in pairs. Coffee cherries grow along the branches. Because it grows in a continuous cycle,
                    it’s not unusual to see flowers, green fruit and ripe fruit simultaneously on a single tree.
                    It takes nearly a year for a cherry to mature after first flowering, and about 5 years of growth to
                    reach full fruit production. While coffee plants can live up to 100 years, they are generally the
                    most productive between the ages of 7 and 20. Proper care can maintain and even increase their
                    output over the years, depending on the variety. The average coffee tree produces 10 pounds of
                    coffee cherry per year, or 2 pounds of green beans.

                    All commercially grown coffee is from a region of the world called the Coffee Belt. The trees grow
                    best in rich soil, with mild temperatures, frequent rain and shaded sun

        <h2>Botanical classification</h2>
        <p id="alw">
            Coffee traces its origin to a genus of plants known as Coffea. Within the genus there are over 500 genera
            and 6,000 species of tropical trees and shrubs. Experts estimate that there are anywhere from 25 to 100
            species of coffee plants.

            The genus was first described in the 18th century by the Swedish botanist, Carolus Linneaus, who also
            described Coffea Arabica in his Species Plantarum in 1753. Botanists have disagreed ever since on the exact
            classification, since coffee plants can range widely. They can be small shrubs to tall trees, with leaves
            from one to 16 inches in size, and in colors from purple or yellow to the predominant dark green.

            In the commercial coffee industry, there are two important coffee species — Arabica and Robusta.
        </p>
        <h2>Coffea Arabica — C. Arabica</h2>
        <p id="p4">
            Varieties: Bourbon, Typica, Caturra, Mundo Novo, Tico, San Ramon, Jamaican Blue Mountain

            Coffea Arabica is descended from the original coffee trees discovered in Ethiopia. These trees produce a
            fine, mild, aromatic coffee and represent approximately 70% of the world's coffee production. The beans are
            flatter and more elongated than Robusta and lower in caffeine.

            On the world market, Arabica coffees bring the highest prices. The better Arabicas are high grown coffees —
            generally grown between 2,000 to 6,000 feet (610 to 1830 meters) above sea level — though optimal altitude
            varies with proximity to the equator.

            The most important factor is that temperatures must remain mild, ideally between 59 - 75 degrees Fahrenheit,
            with about 60 inches of rainfall a year. The trees are hearty, but a heavy frost will kill them.

            Arabica trees are costly to cultivate because the ideal terrain tends to be steep and access is difficult.
            Also, because the trees are more disease-prone than Robusta, they require additional care and attention.
        </p>
        <h2>The Anatomy of a Coffee Cherry</h2>
        <p id="p4">
            The beans you brew are actually the processed and roasted seeds from a fruit, which is called a coffee
            cherry.

            The coffee cherry's outer skin is called the exocarp. Beneath it is the mesocarp, a thin layer of pulp,
            followed by a slimy layer called the parenchyma. The beans themselves are covered in a paper-like envelope
            named the endocarp, more commonly referred to as the parchment.

            Inside the parchment, side-by-side, lie two beans, each covered separately by yet another thin membrane. The
            biological name for this seed skin is the spermoderm, but it is generally referred to in the coffee trade as
            the silver skin.



            In about 5% of the world's coffee, there is only one bean inside the cherry. This is called a peaberry (or a
            caracol, or "snail" in Spanish), and it is a natural mutation. Some people believe that peaberries are
            actually sweeter and more flavorful than standard beans, so they are sometimes manually sorted out for
            special sale.
